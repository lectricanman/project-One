Ok so right now we've got this:
        1: a level space that consists of 6 white divs (squares)
        2: a function that creates these squares and adds click events to them
        3: a function that turns random squares red
      NEVERMIND  NOTE: number 3 over here isn't done.NEVER MIND We need to set a delay to turn the
        squares back to wNEVERMINDhite so that you know, it's actually a game?NEVER MIND
        4: a working start button that creates our 1st level and plays it on a delay
        NOTE: number 4 does not include a delay to the makeRed() function that would offset the timing in which
        new red squares would apear. not sure if that's actually a good idea or not.
So, what we need is a time out function set to play once per second
the time out will clear once a "time" variable is set to zero

we also need a delay function which will call makeRed(); every: .6-.8 seconds?

finally we need a check when the timer reaches zero to see if the player was in
fact able to meet the goal for the level. Oh and also I'm still unsure whether
it is better to punish misclicks with loss of points or time. depending on how
much time is subtracted we might end up with less potential points over all.


After all of this we should be able to add in more levels. Whether or not I should be focussed more on
adding game elements/difficulty via hard coding new levels (structured gameplay) or focus on refactoring my
code so I can create a system where I don't need to define as much css
