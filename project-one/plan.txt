Ok so right now we've got this:
        1: a level space that consists of 6 white divs (squares)
        2: a function that creates these squares and adds click events to them
        3: a function that turns random squares red
        NOTE: number 3 over here isn't done. We need to set a delay to turn the
        squares back to white so that you know, it's actually a game?
So, what we need is a time out function set to play once per second
the time out will clear once a "time" variable is set to zero
we also need a delay function which will call makeRed(); every: .6-.8 seconds?
finally we need a check when the timer reaches zero to see if the player was in
fact able to meet the goal for the level. Oh and also I'm still unsure whether
it is better to punish misclicks with loss of points or time. depending on how
much time is subtracted we might end up with less potential points over all.
